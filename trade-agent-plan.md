# Trading Agent Development Plan

## Next Steps & Strategy for Completing the Modules

1. **Data Fetcher (`data/fetcher.py`)**
   - Implement caching (e.g., using a KV store) to respect rate limits.
   - Add error handling and logging.
   - Test with real API keys.

2. **Strategy Logic (`strategy/signals.py` & `strategy/risk.py`)**
   - Unit test the SMA/RSI logic.
   - Refine position sizing based on current equity and open positions.
   - Integrate with backtesting (e.g., `backtesting.py`) for validation.

3. **Paper Trading (`broker/paper.py`)**
   - Replace placeholders with actual Alpaca API calls.
   - Add order validation and error handling.
   - Simulate order execution and track trades.

4. **Database (`db/supabase.py`)**
   - Set up Supabase/Postgres tables for trades, positions, and equity.
   - Test database writes and reads.
   - Ensure data consistency.

5. **Configuration (`config.py`)**
   - Load environment variables securely.
   - Add validation for required keys.

6. **Utilities (`utils.py`)**
   - Enhance logging and error handling.
   - Add more utility functions as needed.

7. **Main Loop (`main.py`)**
   - Integrate all modules.
   - Add cron job or container orchestration (e.g., Docker + cron).
   - Test end-to-end flow.

8. **Testing & QA**
   - Write unit tests for each module.
   - Perform integration tests.
   - Run end-to-end tests.

9. **Documentation**
   - Add docstrings and comments.
   - Create a README with setup and usage instructions.

10. **Deployment**
    - Deploy on Vercel (for the dashboard) and a cloud service (for the bot).
    - Monitor logs and performance.
