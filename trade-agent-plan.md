# Trading Agent Development Plan

## Next Steps & Strategy for Completing the Modules

1. **Data Fetcher (`data/fetcher.py`)**
   - [x] Implement caching (e.g., using a KV store) to respect rate limits.
   - [x] Add error handling and logging.
   - [x] Test with real API keys.

2. **Strategy Logic (`strategy/signals.py` & `strategy/risk.py`)**
   - [x] Unit test the SMA/RSI logic.
   - [x] Refine position sizing based on current equity and open positions.
   - [x] Integrate with backtesting (e.g., `backtesting.py`) for validation.

3. **Paper Trading (`broker/paper.py`)**
   - [x] Replace placeholders with actual Alpaca API calls.
   - [x] Add order validation and error handling.
   - [x] Simulate order execution and track trades.

4. **Database (`db/supabase.py`)**
   - [x] Set up Supabase/Postgres tables for trades, positions, and equity.

7. **Main Loop (`main.py`)**
   - [ ] Integrate all modules.
   - [ ] Add cron job or container orchestration (e.g., Docker + cron).
   - [ ] Test end-to-end flow.

8. **Testing & QA**
   - [ ] Write unit tests for each module.
   - [ ] Perform integration tests.
   - [ ] Run end-to-end tests.

9. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Add docstrings and comments.
   - [ ] Create a README with setup and usage instructions.

10. **Deployment**
